# Setup Instructions

Create a README.md file containing Android Studio setup instructions: the URL to clone, what to click, what paths to enter. Since at least 4 of you will be doing this, just take good notes on what to do to clone the repo and create the project!

## Cloning the project

* URL to clone: https://markus.teach.cs.toronto.edu/git/csc207-2018-09-reg/group_0581
*

## Using the App

* When you open the app it will ask you to sign up/ sign in with an email and password.
* After signing up/in it will take you to the Sliding Tiles game screen, where you can choose to either start a new game or load a saved one.
* If starting a new game it will let you choose the difficulty of the game, this means how many tiles and undos you have.
